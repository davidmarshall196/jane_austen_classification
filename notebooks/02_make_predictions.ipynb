He hated the Roman money he had, and grew fonder\\nof the real money denied him.  He not only sold the Collection\\nbit by bit, but sank bit by bit to the basest ways of making money--\\neven to blackmailing his own family in a disguise.  He blackmailed\\nhis brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime (that is why\\nhe took the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney), he blackmailed his sister\\nfor the theft he alone could have noticed.

We are up in the sky.\\nIn your religion and all the religions, as far as I know (and I\\nknow everything), the sky is made the symbol of everything that\\nis sacred and merciful.  Well, now you are in the sky, you know\\nbetter.  Phrase it how you like, twist it how you like, you know\\nthat you know better.  You know what are a man\\'s real feelings\\nabout the heavens, when he finds himself alone in the heavens,\\nsurrounded by the heavens.  You know the truth, and the truth is\\nthis.  The heavens are evil, the sky is evil, the stars are evil.\\nThis mere space, this mere quantity, terrifies a man more than\\ntigers or the terrible plague.  You know that since our science\\nhas spoken, the bottom has fallen out of the Universe.  Now,\\nheaven is the hopeless thing, more hopeless than any hell.  Now,\\nif there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid\\napes, it must be in the earth, underneath you, under the roots of\\nthe grass, in the place where hell was of old.  The fiery crypts,\\nthe lurid cellars of the underworld, to which you once condemned\\nthe wicked, are hideous enough, but at least they are more homely\\nthan the heaven in which we ride.  And the time will come when you\\nwill all hide in them, to escape the horror of the stars.\"',\n",
